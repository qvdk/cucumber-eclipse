## Installation and further information

- Please head over to the [plugin website](http://cucumber.github.com/cucumber-eclipse) for more information.

- After you install the Cucumber-Eclipse plugin, you can use it to run Cucumber-JVM. To do this, you will need to install all the libraries you want to use for Cucumber-JVM into your Eclipse project's build-path libraries. The list of required dependencies can be found here [cucumber-jvm-installation](https://docs.cucumber.io/installation/java/). Another good resource for reference is the [cucumber-java-skeleton](https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber-java-skeleton/) example at GitHub.

- If the output to the console has jumbled characters in it, you may want to install the [ANSI Escape in Console plugin](https://marketplace.eclipse.org/content/ansi-escape-console). This interprets the jumbled characters to create nicely colored text in the console output.

- Create a new feature file from Eclipse by selecting New => File from the menu and naming it with a ".feature" suffix to bring up the Feature Editor. After typing in the Gherkin code for a test, select Run => Run to invoke Cucumber-JVM on that feature. This will also create a run configuration, which you can modify and rename by selecting Run => Run Configurarations.... Tags are not available in Cucumber-Eclipse, but you can organize your features into directories and select the Feature Path that you want the run configuration to use. You can execute run configurations from the Run => Run History menu.

- Another alternative is to use Cucumber-Eclipse for editing feature files and getting the generated step-definition stubs, but then running a Junit file with a @RunWith(cucumber.class) annotation similar to the cucumber-java-skeleton [RunCukesTest.java](https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber-java-skeleton/blob/master/src/test/java/skeleton/RunCukesTest.java). The @CucumberOptions most useful are

* Run the feature or all features below the directory
  ```gherkin
  features = {"featurePath/dir1", "featurePath2/dir/one_more.feature", ...}
  ```

* Run all features with the given tag
  ```gherkin
  tags = {"@tag1", "@tag2", ...}
  ```

* Use the listed formatter
  ```gherkin
  format = "progress"
  ```

* Find the step definition and hooks below the given directory
  ```gherkin
  glue = "my_feature_steps/dir"
  ```

The full option list can be found at [Cucumber-Options](https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber-jvm/blob/master/core/src/main/java/cucumber/api/CucumberOptions.java)

## Build and install from source

To use the latest features, you can choose to build and install from source.

- Build the plugin using Maven (https://maven.apache.org/) <code>mvn clean install</code>
- Open Eclipse and navigate to Help -> Install New Software... -> Add
- Point to the update-site built in step 1: <code>file:path_to_repo/cucumber.eclipse.p2updatesite/target/repository</code>
- Proceed to install like any other plug-in

## How soon will my ticket be fixed?

The best way to have a bug fixed or feature request implemented is to
to fork the cucumber-eclipse repository and send a
[pull request](http://help.github.com/send-pull-requests/).
If the pull request is reasonable it has a good chance of
making it into the next release. If you build the release yourself, even more chance!

If you don't fix the bug yourself (or pay someone to do it for you), the bug might never get fixed. If it is a serious
bug, other people than you might care enough to provide a fix.

In other words, there is no guarantee that a bug or feature request gets fixed. Tickets that are more than 6 months old
are likely to be closed to keep the backlog manageable.
